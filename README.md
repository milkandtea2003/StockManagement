## Getting Started

To run the Stock Management application locally, follow these steps:

### Frontend Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/milkandtea2003/StockManagement.git

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install frontend dependencies using npm or yarn:

cd stockmanagement.client
npm install

3. **Run the Frontend**: Start the frontend development server:

npm run start

4. **Access the Frontend**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the Stock Management application frontend.

### Backend Setup

5. **Open Backend Solution**: Navigate to the `StockManagement` folder in the cloned repository and locate the backend solution file (e.g., `StockManagement.sln`).

6. **Configure and Run the Backend**: Open the backend solution file in Visual Studio. If you don't have Visual Studio installed, you can download and install it from [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). Once opened, build and run the backend project to start the ASP.NET Core Web Api server.

7. **Verify Backend Server**: After running the backend project, verify that the backend server is running and accessible.

8. **Connect Frontend to Backend**: Once the backend server is running, the frontend should automatically connect to it for data access and manipulation.

9. **Access the Application**: With both frontend and backend servers running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to access the Stock Management application.

If you encounter any issues during setup or have questions about running the application, feel free to reach out for assistance.
